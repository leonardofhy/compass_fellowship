## Evaluative Questions

**Help us learn more about how you think about and approach the world, others, and yourself.**

*All questions are optional. We recommend responding to two or more questions and keeping responses to within 300 words. We would be happy to receive a "partial" answer on a question. We want to see the process of your thinking.*

### 1. What’s something you would like to understand better? How do you hope to achieve this?

### 2. Teach us something you learned recently.

最近進入頂尖 AI 實驗室做研究，我學到了關於卓越研究環境與研究者的四個觀察：

人才聚集效應：頂尖的團隊往往可以聚集更多經驗豐富，或者研究能力更強的研究人員，這種人才密度本身就是一種優勢。

高密度環境的問題篩選功能：在這種環境更容易發現好問題，因為可以在想問題的時候，通過經驗、知識和邏輯推理能力排除一些成功率不高，或者研究 taste 不夠好的題目。

極高的體力與精力要求：強的研究者往往體力和精力很驚人，他們擅長在高強度工作中保存高品質的輸出。

導師的多維度價值：好的 advisor 不僅可以提供好的 connection，更能在研究上提供有效的指導，指導學生更好的解決問題。

🚀 成功率加分項：

連結到「建模」： 你提到的第 2 點（篩選問題）其實就是一種「智識建模」。如果你能稍微提到這種篩選機制如何運作（例如：基於什麼邏輯排除壞題目），會更強。

### 3. Tell us something you find beautiful.

### 4. Analyze for us the purpose of your major (or your current field of study/pursuit).
*What is it trying to teach or do in the world? How does it seek to do so?*

### 5. List at least 50 questions you have about the world.
*Feel free to exceed the recommended 300 word limit for this question.*

## LLM Usage

**If you used LLMs (Large Language Models) in crafting your responses, how did you use it?**
*If you didn't use LLMs, we are also curious as to why you chose not to, or feel free to leave this section blank.*
