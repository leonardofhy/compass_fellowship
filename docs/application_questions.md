**📝 Draft Answer (v1):**

I want to understand how different stakeholders—academia, industry, government, and civil society—can coordinate on AI development without falling into gridlock.

As an organizer of the **Taiwan AI Safety Reading Group** and a former engineer on Taiwan's national LLM project (TAIDE), I've observed a recurring pattern: each stakeholder operates under fundamentally different logics. Academia pursues truth and long-term impact. Industry optimizes for ROI and risk mitigation. Government focuses on regulation and public accountability. Non-profits try to balance these competing interests.

I find myself drawn to a metaphor: AI is to our era what the textile machine was to the Industrial Revolution—a technology that will inevitably reshape social structures. But unlike the textile machine, we have the opportunity to anticipate and shape these changes.

How do I hope to achieve this understanding? Through three approaches:
1. **Modeling stakeholder incentives** — mapping what each group optimizes for and where conflicts emerge
2. **Studying historical precedents** — how did society coordinate around previous transformative technologies?
3. **Building bridges** — as someone who has worked in both industry and academia, I want to facilitate dialogue between communities that rarely talk to each other

This program's interdisciplinary approach—drawing from game theory, sociology, and philosophy—feels like exactly the intellectual environment I need to deepen this inquiry.

**📝 Draft Answer (v1):**

Recently, I joined a top AI research lab. Here's what I learned about how elite research environments actually work—essentially, a model of "research institution dynamics."

**Four observations:**

1. **Talent density is itself a competitive advantage.** Top teams attract experienced researchers, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. The "average quality of conversation" becomes a form of intellectual infrastructure.

2. **High-density environments enable better problem selection.** In such environments, researchers can quickly filter out unpromising research directions. They draw on collective experience, domain knowledge, and logical reasoning to eliminate topics with low success rates or poor "research taste." This filtering mechanism is a form of *intellectual modeling*—pattern-matching against years of tacit knowledge.

3. **Elite researchers have remarkable physical stamina.** Sustained high-quality output under pressure requires not just intelligence, but endurance. This was humbling to witness.

4. **Great advisors provide multi-dimensional value.** Beyond connections, they offer effective guidance on problem decomposition and solution strategies.

**Why this matters:** These observations taught me that research excellence isn't just about individual brilliance—it's about *modeling and selecting the right problems*. The second point, in particular, changed how I think about my own research: instead of asking "Can I solve this?", I now ask "Is this worth solving, and how would I know?"

This is, in essence, applying the same modeling mindset that AI systems use—but turned inward, on the craft of research itself.

**📝 Draft Answer (v1):**

My field is **AI and Natural Language Processing**. Let me analyze its purpose at three levels:

**Surface purpose:** Build systems that process and generate human language—translation, search, conversation.

**Deeper purpose:** Bridge the gap between human cognition and machine capability. Language is how humans encode knowledge, coordinate action, and transmit culture. NLP attempts to make this vast repository of human meaning accessible to computation.

**Critical lens—what does the field assume, and what does it miss?**

The field implicitly assumes that language can be modeled through statistical patterns in text. But working on Taiwan's Indigenous language translation project taught me the limits of this assumption. For low-resource languages with oral traditions, there simply isn't enough text data. The field's methods—trained on English, Chinese, and other "data-rich" languages—may be inadvertently encoding a form of linguistic imperialism.

Similarly, my experience on Taiwan's national LLM project (TAIDE) revealed a tension: the field optimizes for *capability* (benchmarks, speed, fluency) while *safety* is often an afterthought. The purpose of NLP, as currently practiced, is to make language models more powerful. But perhaps the deeper purpose should be: to make them more *aligned* with human values.

This is why I now focus on AI Safety—not as a separate subfield, but as a necessary reorientation of the field's core purpose.

## LLM Usage

**If you used LLMs (Large Language Models) in crafting your responses, how did you use it?**
*If you didn't use LLMs, we are also curious as to why you chose not to, or feel free to leave this section blank.*

> 💡 **策略提示：** 誠實透明。建議的表達方式：

I learned about the Compass Fellowship through recommendations from **Alvin Lau** and **Sin-tshong Tsu**.

- **Anything else you would like to share with us?**

**📝 Draft Answer (v1):**

I'm 27 years old—slightly above your typical age range. I want to address this directly.

I'm applying because I believe my experience offers a perspective that might be valuable to this cohort:

- As an engineer on **Taiwan's national LLM project (TAIDE)**, I witnessed how a $10M government initiative navigates the tension between capability and safety at national scale.
- As an **organizer of the Taiwan AI Safety Reading Group**, I've been building bridges between researchers who care about alignment and a broader Taiwanese tech community that often prioritizes speed over safety.
- Having worked in both **industry** (AI startup) and **academia** (NTU research labs), I've developed frameworks for modeling how different institutions approach risk and innovation differently.

I'm at a point where I'm actively reflecting on what kind of researcher—and person—I want to become. The Compass Fellowship's emphasis on introspection and modeling feels timely: I've spent years building technical skills, and now I want to develop the wisdom to use them well.

I'm excited about the possibility of learning alongside younger participants. I hope my experience might be useful to them, and I'm certain their fresh perspectives will challenge my assumptions.
