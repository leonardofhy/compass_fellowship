## About the Program

### What Is the Compass Fellowship?

The Compass Fellowship seeks to develop three core capacities:

1. **Seeing the world more clearly**
2. **Reflecting on your values**
3. **Executing with intention**

We believe these abilities are all essential, yet often neglected, skills in one's education. In today's world, these abilities are more crucial than ever for both navigating personal success and global challenges.

With a 5-day intensive, we host an interdisciplinary space for intellectually curious and ambitious students to learn and practice these abilities alongside peers and world-class instructors.

Through the program, Compass Fellows will leave with an expanded sense of the "possibility space" in their life while forming relationships that will help them continue their inquiries and execute their visions.

## What We Will Explore

Modeling, introspection, and execution are abilities generally not limited to specific subjects of study but are rather themselves parts of how **Learning is learned**. To this end, our curriculum pulls from wide-ranging domains that afford different approaches to learning these abilities.

### Curriculum Examples

| Domain | Topics Covered |
|--------|----------------|
| **Cognitive Science / Psychology** | How do "biases" form and how do they influence our emotions and decision making? What can we then do about them? |
| **Game Theory / Decision Making Theory** | How can we model each other's behavior in incentivized contexts? How does this appear in personal and global gridlocks? |
| **Statistics / Information Theory** | How do we understand information and data? How can we leverage data available to us to model our lives and the world under uncertainty? |
| **Sociology / Political Science** | What are institutions and what roles do they play in our lives? How can we understand their objectives and behaviors within broader cultural contexts? |
| **Literature / Philosophy** | How do we interpret various, often conflicting, schools of thought accumulated over millennia of history? How can these inform our own values and preferences on the world? |

## Our Methodology

Lectures alone are rarely sufficient for the integration of profound ideas. In composing a cohort of inquisitive, thoughtful individuals, we focus on **small class sizes** where we can dive into subjects of life, in or out of academics, that are often neglected.

By living together for 5 days, we give abundant space for **immersive dialogue** that can go to depths usually unavailable. Great degrees of freedom are also given to participants to create or ask for the sessions they would find most engaging.

The learning environment will be unlike most education programs, emphasizing our **intrinsic interests** as the compass for what we want to learn and pursue.

### A Day in the Life: Example

*Suppose a participant, Alice, is interested in becoming a more effective communicator:*

- **Morning:** Alice might attend lectures on "Modeling Communication Theory" and/or "Negotiations 101", covering both theoretical and applied aspects of communication.

- **Afternoon:** Alice may go to a workshop called "Understanding Physiology in High Stakes Communication". Inspired by the workshop, she decides to host a discussion group in the evening called "Sharing Personal Challenges in Communication".

- **Late Evening:** She may choose to reflect on what she learned that day through journaling, or engage in small group discussions organically with other staff and participants about why communication is an important subject for her.

## FAQ

### Where is the program held?

The Compass Fellowship Program will be hosted in Taipei at the **9Floor CoLiving Space** near Wenshan District.

| **Second Cohort** | Monday, February 2 – Saturday, February 7 |

### Who is this for?

The Compass Fellowship is for curious and ambitious university students interested in reflecting and exploring greater breadth and depth in understanding themselves and the world.

We accept university students (or those aged 18-23), particularly those in Taiwan, accepting about 20 students for each cohort. Those outside the 18-23 age range are welcome to apply; some exceptions may be made for highly fitting applicants.

While the program won't have any hard pre-requisites, the staff team tends to have careers in STEM, so comfort with mathematics is recommended but not required.

### What are the costs?

The program is **free to attend** and includes meals and accommodation. Need-based scholarships to cover the cost of travel are available.

### Can international students apply?

Yes! To compose an exceptional cohort with diverse backgrounds and views, we also accept international applicants.

### What is the application process?

Our admissions will be run in two stages:

1. **Written application**
2. **Interview** (~45 minutes, conversational with one of our staff)

We want to see you as you are and how you normally think.

Admissions run from mid-November to early January on a **rolling basis**. This means we will start interviewing as soon as applications are reviewed (usually within one to two weeks) until spots are filled.

If the application is still open, feel free to send in your application as last-minute admits are still possible.

**Application officially closes on January 3, 2026.**

### Who is funding this?

The Compass Fellowship is generously funded by **Emergent Ventures** and **SPARC**.

### Who are the instructors?

We have gathered an exceptionally accomplished staff team including graduates of Harvard and MIT with wide-ranging work and life experiences from academic research, venture capital, startups, and more. See the Team section above for details.

### What inspired this program?

The program is inspired by programs like **SPARC**, which has been operating since 2012 with alumni who have gone on to be prominent researchers, high-valuation founders, and much more.

We believe the ability to model the world, introspect on one's own experience, and implement one's vision are all crucial, yet often neglected, skills in one's education. There is much room for expressing interesting and effective means of honing these skills, and we are particularly interested in how this could work in an **East Asian context**.

Having already had positive experience in prototyping education programs in Taiwan, we are excited to pilot a program that is more deliberately Asian-focused.

### Is the program in English or Chinese?

The program will be run in **English**. Though most staff members are proficient in Chinese, it is recommended that you are comfortable in an English-speaking environment.

That said, if you are interested in applying, we **strongly encourage you to do so**, even if you might not be sure your English is up to par! We are looking for participants with high willingness to participate, not perfect English abilities.
